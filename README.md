The size of image dataset used for training and testing is too big and simply cannot be uploaded here. You can download this dataset from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XQU0pluL0m3TIlXqntano12d68peMb8A?usp=sharing

Since the SVM model.p file is too big, we have not uploaded it to GitHub.

Here is the final report:
